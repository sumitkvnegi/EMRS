# Attribute:

- Explanation: An attribute is a characteristic or property of an object. In the context of a database, it represents a specific piece of information stored in a table.
- Example: In a "Students" table, attributes could include "StudentID," "FirstName," "LastName," and "DateOfBirth."

# Domain:

- Explanation: Domain refers to the set of possible values that an attribute can have. It defines the range of values that a particular attribute can take.
- Example: The domain of the "Age" attribute might be integers between 0 and 150.

# Tuple:

- Explanation: A tuple is a single row in a table, representing a specific occurrence or instance of the entity the table is designed to store.
- Example: In a "Customers" table, each tuple represents information about a specific customer, such as their name, address, and phone number.

# Relation:

- Explanation: A relation is a table that stores data in a structured format with rows and columns. Each row in the table is a tuple, and each column is an attribute.
- Example: The "Employees" table is a relation that stores information about different employees.

# Candidate Key:

- Explanation: A candidate key is a unique identifier for a tuple in a table. It is a column or a set of columns that can uniquely identify each record.
- Example: In a "Books" table, the combination of "ISBN" (International Standard Book Number) and "Edition" could be a candidate key.

# Primary Key:

- Explanation: The primary key is a specific candidate key chosen to uniquely identify each tuple in a table. It must be unique for each record and cannot contain NULL values.
- Example: In a "Students" table, the "StudentID" column might be chosen as the primary key.

# Alternate Key:

- Explanation: An alternate key is a candidate key that was not chosen as the primary key. It can be used to uniquely identify records but is not the main identifier for the table.
- Example: In the "Books" table, if we didn't choose "ISBN" as the primary key, it becomes an alternate key.

# Foreign Key:

- Explanation: A foreign key is a column in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a link between the two tables.
- Example: In an "Orders" table, the "CustomerID" column might be a foreign key referencing the "Customers" table's primary key.

# In SQL, various mathematical functions are available to perform operations on numeric data. Here's how you can use the `POWER()`, `ROUND()`, and `MOD()` functions:

1. **POWER() Function:**
   - The `POWER()` function is used to raise a number to a specified power.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   POWER(number, exponent);
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT POWER(2, 3) AS Result;  -- Calculates 2 raised to the power of 3
   ```

2. **ROUND() Function:**
   - The `ROUND()` function is used to round a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   ROUND(number, decimal_places);
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ROUND(3.14159, 2) AS Result;  -- Rounds pi to 2 decimal places
   ```

3. **MOD() Function:**
   - The `MOD()` function returns the remainder of a division between two numbers.

   **Syntax:**
   ```sql
   MOD(dividend, divisor);
   ```

   **Example:**
   ```sql
   SELECT MOD(10, 3) AS Result;  -- Calculates the remainder of 10 divided by 3
   ```

```sql
Copy code
-- Assuming your table structure is something like this
CREATE TABLE student_marks (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    marks DECIMAL(5, 2) -- Assuming marks are stored with 2 decimal places
);

-- Update the marks, rounding them off
UPDATE student_marks
SET marks = ROUND(marks);
```

```sql
Copy code
-- Select student_id and rounded marks
SELECT student_id, ROUND(marks) AS rounded_marks
FROM student_marks;
```

# If you want to permanently store the rounded marks in a new column, you need to add a new column to the table and then update it with the rounded values. Here's an example:

```sql
Copy code
-- Assuming your table structure is something like this
CREATE TABLE student_marks (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    marks DECIMAL(5, 2) -- Assuming marks are stored with 2 decimal places
);

-- Add a new column for rounded marks
ALTER TABLE student_marks
ADD COLUMN rounded_marks DECIMAL(5, 0);

-- Update the new column with rounded values
UPDATE student_marks
SET rounded_marks = ROUND(marks);
```

     ```

2. **MIN():**
   - **Purpose:** Returns the minimum value in a set of values.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT MIN(salary) AS MinSalary FROM employees;
     -- Result: Minimum salary value from the 'employees' table.
     ```

3. **AVG():**
   - **Purpose:** Returns the average (mean) value of a set of values.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(salary) AS AverageSalary FROM employees;
     -- Result: Average salary value from the 'employees' table.

     -- Result: Sum of sales values from the 'sales_data' table.
     ```

5. **COUNT():**
   - **Purpose:** Returns the number of rows in a set.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalRecords FROM customers;
     -- Result: Number of rows in the 'customers' table.
     ```

   - **Note:** The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count all rows in a table regardless of whether they contain NULL values. If you want to count only non-NULL values in a specific column, you can use `COUNT(column_name)`.


# SQL clauses—`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`—and see how they can be used to query and manipulate data.

1. **GROUP BY:**
   - **Purpose:** Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department;
     ```
     This query groups employees by department and calculates the average salary for each department.

2. **HAVING:**
   - **Purpose:** Filters the results of a `GROUP BY` clause based on specified conditions.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department
     HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
     ```
     This query groups employees by department, calculates the average salary for each department, and then filters out departments where the average salary is less than or equal to 50000.

3. **ORDER BY:**
   - **Purpose:** Sorts the result set of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns.
   - **Example:**
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
     FROM employees
     ORDER BY salary DESC;
     ```
     This query retrieves employee details and orders the result set in descending order based on the `salary` column.

Combining these clauses allows for powerful data manipulation. Here's an example that incorporates all three clauses:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000
ORDER BY average_salary DESC;
```

# output will be

| department | employee_count | average_salary |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| IT         | 15              | 60000.00        |
| Finance    | 12              | 58000.00        |
| HR         | 10              | 55000.00        |

# The differences between various network devices—modem, hub, switch, repeater, router, and gateway—by understanding their functions and how they operate within a network:

1. **Modem:**
   - **Function:** Stands for "modulator-demodulator." Modems convert digital data from a computer into analog signals for transmission over telephone lines (for DSL) or cable lines (for cable internet).
   - **Visualization:** Acts as a bridge between the digital world of computers and the analog world of communication lines.

2. **Hub:**
   - **Function:** A basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a LAN. Hubs operate at the physical layer and broadcast data to all connected devices.
   - **Visualization:** Like a central meeting point where all connected devices share the same communication channel.

3. **Switch:**
   - **Function:** Similar to a hub, but smarter. Switches operate at the data link layer and use MAC addresses to forward data only to the specific device it's intended for.
   - **Visualization:** Functions like a traffic cop, directing data only to the intended recipient rather than broadcasting it to all devices.

4. **Repeater:**
   - **Function:** Extends the range of a network by amplifying and retransmitting signals. Used to counteract signal degradation over long distances in a network.
   - **Visualization:** Acts like a signal booster, enhancing the strength and reach of data transmissions.

5. **Router:**
   - **Function:** Connects multiple networks and directs data between them. Routers operate at the network layer, making decisions based on IP addresses.
   - **Visualization:** Serves as a traffic manager for data moving between different networks, determining the best path for data to travel.

6. **Gateway:**
   - **Function:** A device that acts as an interface between different networks, often connecting a local network to the internet. It understands multiple protocols and can translate between them.
   - **Visualization:** Like a bridge between two different worlds, facilitating communication between networks with different protocols.

In a nutshell, you can visualize these devices in a hierarchical structure:

```
                          +---------+
                          | Gateway |
                          +----+----+
                               |
                         +-----+-----+
                         |  Router   |
                         +-----+-----+
                               |

                               |
                +--------------+--------------+
                |                             |
           +----+-----+                 +----+-----+
           | Modem   |                 | Switch 2 |
           +----+-----+                 +----+-----+
                |                             |
           +----+-----+                       |
           |  Hub    |                       |
           +---------+                       |
                                            |
                                       +----+-----+
                                       | Repeater |
                                       +----+-----+
                                            |
                                       +----+-----+
                                       |  Device  |
                                       +---------+
```

In this visualization, devices at the lower layers (hub, switch, repeater) are closer to the physical layer, while devices at higher layers (router, gateway) operate at more abstracted layers, managing traffic between networks. The modem serves as a bridge between the local network and the external communication lines.

# Here's an example Python code that introduces the concept of Python modules, demonstrates how to import modules using `import` and `from` statements, and specifically imports and uses functions from the `math`, `random`, and `statistics` modules:

```python
# Introduction to Python Modules

# Importing the entire math module
import math

# Using functions from the math module
print("Pi:", math.pi)
print("Euler's Number:", math.e)
print("Square Root of 25:", math.sqrt(25))
print("Ceil of 4.3:", math.ceil(4.3))
print("Floor of 4.7:", math.floor(4.7))
print("2 to the power of 3:", math.pow(2, 3))
print("Absolute value of -7.2:", math.fabs(-7.2))
print("Sine of 30 degrees:", math.sin(math.radians(30)))
print("Cosine of 45 degrees:", math.cos(math.radians(45)))
print("Tangent of 60 degrees:", math.tan(math.radians(60)))

# Importing specific functions from the random module
from random import random, randint, randrange

# Using functions from the random module
print("\nRandom Number between 0 and 1:", random())
print("Random Integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive):", randint(1, 10))
print("Random Number from range (start=5, stop=15, step=2):", randrange(5, 15, 2))

# Importing specific functions from the statistics module
from statistics import mean, median, mode

# Using functions from the statistics module
data = [2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9]
print("\nMean of Data:", mean(data))
print("Median of Data:", median(data))
print("Mode of Data:", mode(data))
```

- The `math` module is imported, and various mathematical functions and constants are used.
- The `random` module is imported, and functions like `random()`, `randint()`, and `randrange()` are used for generating random numbers.
- The `statistics` module is imported, and functions like `mean()`, `median()`, and `mode()` are used for statistical calculations.

Certainly! Connecting Python with an SQL database typically involves using a database driver or an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). Here, I'll provide an example using the `sqlite3` module, which is a built-in module in Python for SQLite databases. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database engine that is commonly used for learning purposes and small applications.

```python
import sqlite3

# Connecting to the SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')

# Creating a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Creating a table (if not exists)
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        salary REAL
    )
''')

# Performing INSERT query
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES (?, ?)", ('John Doe', 50000.0))
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES (?, ?)", ('Jane Smith', 60000.0))

# Committing the changes to the database
conn.commit()

# Performing UPDATE query
cursor.execute("UPDATE employees SET salary = ? WHERE name = ?", (55000.0, 'John Doe'))
conn.commit()

# Performing DELETE query
cursor.execute("DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = ?", ('Jane Smith',))
conn.commit()

# Fetching and displaying data using fetchone() and fetchall()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
print("\nData from the database:")
print("ID\tName\t\tSalary")
print("-" * 25)
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(f"{row[0]}\t{row[1]}\t{row[2]}")

# Using rowcount to get the number of affected rows
print("\nNumber of affected rows:", cursor.rowcount)

# Closing the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

In this example:

1. **Connecting to the Database:**
   - The `sqlite3.connect` function is used to connect to an SQLite database. If the database doesn't exist, it will be created.

2. **Creating a Table:**
   - The `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement is executed to create a table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`.

3. **Inserting Data:**
   - The `INSERT INTO` SQL statements are used to insert data into the `employees` table.

4. **Updating Data:**
   - The `UPDATE` SQL statement is used to update the salary of a specific employee.

5. **Deleting Data:**
   - The `DELETE FROM` SQL statement is used to delete a specific employee from the table.

6. **Fetching and Displaying Data:**
   - The `SELECT` SQL statement is used to fetch all data from the `employees` table, and `fetchall()` is used to retrieve all rows.

7. **Rowcount:**
   - The `rowcount` attribute of the cursor is used to get the number of affected rows after executing an SQL statement.

8. **Closing Connections:**
   - Finally, the cursor and connection are closed to release resources.

# pandas

- the concepts of data handling using Pandas and data visualization using Matplotlib in simple terms.

### Data Handling using Pandas:

#### Introduction to Pandas:
Pandas is a Python library that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It's like a superhero for handling and manipulating structured data.

#### Data Structures in Pandas:

1. **Series:**
   - Think of a Series as a column in a spreadsheet. It's a one-dimensional array that can hold any data type.
   - **Creating Series:**
     - From ndarray (NumPy array)
     - From a dictionary
     - With a scalar value
   - **Mathematical Operations:**
     - You can perform operations on Series, like adding or multiplying them.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Creating a Series from a list
   my_list = [10, 20, 30]
   series_from_list = pd.Series(my_list)

   # Mathematical operations on Series
   result_series = series_from_list * 2
   ```

   - **Head and Tail Functions:**
     - They help you see the first or last few elements of your Series.

   ```python
   # Displaying the first 3 elements
   print(result_series.head(3))
   ```

   - **Selection, Indexing, and Slicing:**
     - You can select elements by their index or use slicing to get a subset of your Series.

   ```python
   # Selecting element at index 1
   element_at_index_1 = result_series[1]

   # Slicing to get elements from index 1 to 2
   subset_series = result_series[1:3]
   ```

2. **Data Frames:**
   - Imagine a Data Frame as the entire spreadsheet. It's a two-dimensional table with rows and columns.
   - **Creating Data Frames:**
     - From a dictionary of Series
     - From a list of dictionaries
     - Loading from text/CSV files

   ```python
   # Creating a Data Frame from a dictionary of Series
   data = {'Name': pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob']),
           'Age': pd.Series([25, 30])}

   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   ```

   - **Operations on Rows and Columns:**
     - You can add, select, delete, and rename rows and columns.

   ```python
   # Adding a new column
   df['Salary'] = pd.Series([50000, 60000])

   # Selecting a column
   ages = df['Age']

   # Deleting a column
   del df['Salary']

   # Renaming a column
   df.rename(columns={'Age': 'Years'}, inplace=True)
   ```

   - **Indexing using Labels, Boolean Indexing:**
     - You can use labels to index data, and boolean indexing helps you filter data based on conditions.

   ```python
   # Indexing using labels
   df.set_index('Name', inplace=True)
   alice_data = df.loc['Alice']

   # Boolean indexing
   young_employees = df[df['Years'] < 30]
   ```

### Data Visualization using Matplotlib:

#### Introduction to Matplotlib:
Matplotlib is another powerful library for creating visualizations in Python. It helps you turn your data into meaningful plots and charts.

#### Types of Plots:

1. **Line Plot:**
   - Shows data points connected by lines. Useful for tracking changes over time.

   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   y = [10, 15, 7, 20]

   plt.plot(x, y)
   plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')
   plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')
   plt.title('Line Plot')
   plt.show()
   ```

2. **Bar Graph:**
   - Represents data with rectangular bars. Great for comparing different categories.

   ```python
   categories = ['A', 'B', 'C']
   values = [30, 45, 20]

   plt.bar(categories, values)
   plt.xlabel('Categories')
   plt.ylabel('Values')
   plt.title('Bar Graph')
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Histogram:**
   - Displays the distribution of a dataset. Helpful for understanding the spread of values.

   ```python
   data = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]

   plt.hist(data, bins=5)
   plt.xlabel('Values')
   plt.ylabel('Frequency')
   plt.title('Histogram')
   plt.show()
   ```

#### Customizing Plots:
You can add labels, titles, legends, and more to make your plots informative.

```python
plt.plot(x, y, label='Data Series')
plt.xlabel('X-axis Label')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis Label')
plt.title('Customized Line Plot')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
